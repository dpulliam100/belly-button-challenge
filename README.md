In this challenge I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. In the interactive webpage you can view the data of each sample id used in the data.

The instructor and TA's assisted with the code when filtering the samples field in the dataset, along with chat gpt.
